== Sensors

=== Introduction

((("USB 2.0 host port")))((("sensors", "interfaces for")))In this chapter, you will learn how to sense the physical world with BeagleBone Black. Various types of electronic sensors, such as cameras and microphones, can be connected to the Bone using one or more interfaces provided by the standard USB 2.0 host port, as shown in <<sensors_host_port>>.

((("P8/P9 cape headers", "diagram of")))((("cape headers", "P8/P9 diagram")))The two 46-pin cape headers (called +P8+ and +P9+) along the long edges of the board (<<sensors_P8P9_fig>>) provide connections for cape add-on boards, digital and analog sensors, and more.

((("GPIO pins", "for sensor connections")))((("analog-to-digital converter (ADC) inputs")))((("input mode")))The simplest kind of sensor provides a single digital status, such as off or on, 
and can be handled by an _input mode_ of one of the Bone's 65 general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins. More complex sensors can be connected by using one of the Bone's seven analog-to-digital converter (ADC) inputs or several I^2^C buses. 

<<displays>> discusses some of the _output mode_ usages of the GPIO pins. 

All these examples assume that you know how to edit a file (<<basics_vsc>>) and run it, either within the Visual Studio Code (VSC) integrated development environment (IDE) or from the command line (<<tips_shell>>).

=== Choosing a Method to Connect Your Sensor

==== Problem

((("sensors", "connection options")))((("P8/P9 cape headers", "sensor connection options")))((("cape headers", "P8/P9 connection options")))You want to acquire and attach a sensor and need to understand your basic options.

==== Solution

<<sensors_cape_headers>> shows many of the possibilities for connecting a sensor.

=== Input and Run a Python or JavaScript Application for Talking to Sensors

==== Problem
((("sensors", "entering and running code")))((("code", "entering and running on sensors")))((("JavaScript", "sensor communication with")))You have your sensors all wired up and your Bone booted up, and you need to know how to enter and run your code.

==== Solution
((("vsc", "running JavaScript applications from")))((("bash command window")))You are just a few simple steps from running any of the recipes in this book.

. Plug your Bone into a host computer via the USB cable (<<basics_out_of_the_box>>).
. Start Visual Studio Code (<<basics_vsc>>).
. In the +bash+ tab (as shown in <<sensors_vsc_bash>>), run the following commands:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>cd</strong>
bone$ <strong>cd BoneCookbook/docs/02sensors/code</strong>

By default, it takes you to your home directory. Notice that the prompt has changed to reflect the change. 

[NOTE]
====
If you log in as +debian+, your home is _/home/debian_. If you were to create a new user called +newuser+, that user's home would be _/home/newuser_. By default, all non-root (non-superuser) users have their home directories in _/home_.

. Double-click the _pushbutton.py_ file to open it.
. Press ^S (Ctrl-S) to save the file. (You can also go to the File menu in VSC and select Save to save the file, but Ctrl-S is easier.) Even easier, VSC can be configured to autosave every so many seconds.
. In the +bash+ tab, enter the following commands:

++++

[[sensors_pushbutton]]
=== Reading the Status of a Pushbutton or Magnetic Switch (Passive On/Off Sensor)

==== Problem

((("sensors", "passive on/off")))((("passive on/off sensors")))((("on/off sensors")))((("pushbutton sensors")))((("magnetic switches")))You want to read a pushbutton, a magnetic switch, or other sensor that is electrically open or closed.

==== Solution

((("pinMode()")))((("b.pinMode()")))((("attachInterrupt()")))((("b.attachInterrupt()")))Connect the switch to a GPIO pin and read from the proper place in +/sys/class/gpio"+.

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires
* Pushbutton switch
* Magnetic reed switch (optional)

You can wire up either a pushbutton, a magnetic reed switch, or both on the Bone, as shown in <<js_pushbutton_fig>>.

[[js_pushbutton_fig]]
.Diagram for wiring a pushbutton and magnetic reed switch input
image::figures/pushbutton_bb.png[Bone with pushbutton]

The code in <<js_pushbutton_code>> reads GPIO port +P9_42+, which is attached to the pass:[<span class="keep-together">pushbutton</span>].

((("pushbutton.js file")))Put this code in a file called _pushbutton.js_ following the steps in <<sensors_getting_started>>. In the VSC +bash+ tab, run it by using the following commands:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>./pushbutton.js</strong>
data = 0
data = 0
data = 1
data = 1

The command runs it. Try pushing the button. The code reads the pin and prints its current value.

((("code", "stopping")))((("&#x005E;C (Ctrl-C) command")))((("commands", "&#x005E;C (Ctrl-C)")))You will have to press ^C (Ctrl-C) to stop the code.

If you want to use the magnetic reed switch wired as shown in <<js_pushbutton_fig>>, change +P9_42+ to +P9_26+ which is gpio +14+. 

==== Discussion

[[sensors_mappiing]]
=== Mapping Header Numbers to gpio Numbers

==== Problem

You have a sensor attached to the P8 or P9 header and need to know which gpio pin it's using.

==== Solution

The +gpioinfo+ command displays information about all the P8 and P9 header pins.  To see the info for just one pin, use +grep+.

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>gpioinfo | grep -e chip -e P9.42</strong>
gpiochip0 - 32 lines:
	line   7: "P8_42A [ecappwm0]" "P9_42" input active-high [used]
gpiochip1 - 32 lines:
gpiochip2 - 32 lines:
gpiochip3 - 32 lines:

</pre>
++++
This shows P9_42  is on  chip 0 and pin 7.  To find the gpio number multiply the chip number by 32 and add it to the pin number.  This gives 0*32+7=7.  

For P9_26 you get:
++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>gpioinfo | grep -e chip -e P9.26</strong>
gpiochip0 - 32 lines:
	line  14: "P9_26 [uart1_rxd]" "P9_26" input active-high [used]
gpiochip1 - 32 lines:
gpiochip2 - 32 lines:
gpiochip3 - 32 lines:

++++
0*32+14=14, so the P9_26 pin is gpio 14.

=== Reading a Position, Light, or Force Sensor (Variable Resistance Sensor)

==== Problem

((("sensors", "variable resistance")))((("variable resistance sensors", "reading")))(((position sensors)))(((light sensors)))(((force-sensitive resistors)))((("flex sensors")))You have a variable resistor, force-sensitive resistor, flex sensor, or any of a number of other sensors that output their value as a variable resistance, and you want to read their value with the Bone.

==== Solution

((("analog-to-digital converter (ADC) inputs")))((("resistor divider circuits")))Use the Bone's analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and a resistor divider circuit to detect the resistance in the sensor.

The Bone has seven built-in analog inputs that can easily read a resistive value. <<sensors_cape_headers_analog>> shows them on the lower part of the +P9+ header.

[[sensors_cape_headers_analog]]
.Seven analog inputs on the +P9+ header
image::figures/cape-headers-analog.png[Seven analog inputs on P9 header]

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires
* 10 k&#8486; trimpot
or
* Flex resistor (optional)
* 22 k&#8486; resistor

===== A variable resistor with three terminals

((("trimpots")))((("variable resistance sensors", "three terminal")))<<sensors_analogIn_fig>> shows a simple variable resistor (trimpot) wired to the Bone. One end terminal is wired to the ADC 1.8 V power supply on pin +P9_32+, and the other end terminal is attached to the ADC ground (+P9_34+). The middle terminal is wired to one of the seven analog-in ports (+P9_36+).

===== A variable resistor with two terminals

((("variable resistance sensors", "two terminal")))Some resistive sensors have only two terminals, such as the flex sensor in <<sensors_flexResistor_fig>>.
The resistance between its two terminals changes when it is flexed.
In this case, we need to add a fixed resistor in series with the flex sensor. 
<<sensors_flexResistor_fig>> shows how to wire in a 22 k&#8486; resistor to give a voltage to measure
across the flex sensor.

The code in <<py_analogIn_code>> and <<sensors_analogIn_code>> also works for this setup.

=== Reading a Distance Sensor (Analog or Variable Voltage Sensor)

==== Problem

((("sensors", "analog or variable voltage")))((("distance sensors")))((("analog voltage sensors")))((("variable voltage sensors")))((("voltage sensors")))((("LV-MaxSonar-EZ1 Sonar Range Finder")))You want to measure distance with a http://bit.ly/1Mt5Elr[LV-MaxSonar-EZ1 Sonar Range Finder], which outputs a voltage in proportion to the distance.

==== Solution

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires
* LV-MaxSonar-EZ1 Sonar Range Finder

All you have to do is wire the EZ1 to one of the Bone's _analog-in_ pins, as shown in <<sensors_ultrasonic_fig>>. The device outputs ~6.4 mV/in when powered from 3.3 V.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure not to apply more than 1.8 V to the Bone's _analog-in_ pins, or you will likely damage them. In practice, this circuit should follow that rule.

=== Reading a Distance Sensor (Variable Pulse Width Sensor)
// TODO
==== Problem
((("sensors", "variable pulse width")))((("variable pulse width sensors")))((("pulse width sensors")))((("HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Range Sensor")))((("distance sensors")))You want to use a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Range Sensor with BeagleBone Black.

==== Solution
((("Trigger input")))((("Echo output")))The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Range Sensor (shown in <<sensors_hc_sr04_image_fig>>) works by sending a trigger pulse to the _Trigger_ input and then measuring the pulse width on the _Echo_ output. The width of the pulse tells you the distance.

To make this recipe, you will need:

* 10 k&#8486; and 20 k&#8486; resistors
* HC-SR04 Ultrsonic Range Sensor

Wire the sensor as shown in <<sensors_hc-sr04_fig>>. Note that the HC-SR04 is a 5 V
device, so the _banded_ wire (running from +P9_7+ on the Bone to VCC on the range finder) attaches the HC-SR04 to the Bone's 5 V power supply.

=== Accurately Reading the Position of a Motor or Dial

==== Problem

((("sensors", "rotation")))((("position sensors")))((("rotary encoders")))((("dial position")))You have a motor or dial and want to detect rotation using a rotary encoder.

==== Solution

((("quadrature encoder")))((("eQEP2 encoder")))Use a rotary encoder (also called a _quadrature encoder_) connected to one of the Bone's eQEP ports, as shown in <<digital_rotaryEncoder_fig>>.

[[digital_rotaryEncoder_fig]]
.Wiring a rotary encoder using eQEP2
image::figures/rotaryEncoder_bb.png[rotaryEncoder]

On the BeagleBone and PocketBeage the three encoders are:
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|eQEP0 | P9.27 and P9.42 OR P1_33 and P2_34 
|eQEP1 | P9.33 and P9.35
|eQEP2 | P8.11 and P8.12 OR P2_24 and P2_33
|===

On the AI it's:
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|eQEP1 | P8.33 and P8.35
|eQEP2 | P8.11 and P8.12 or P9.19 and P9.41
|eQEP3 |P8.24 and P8.25 or P9.27 and P9.42
|===

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires
* Rotary encoder

We are using a quadrature rotary encoder, which has two switches inside that open and close in such a manner that you can tell which way the shaft is turning. In this particular encoder, the two switches have a common lead, which is wired to ground. It also has a pushbutton switch wired to the other side of the device, which we aren't using. 

Wire the encoder to +P8_11+ and +P8_12+, as shown in <<digital_rotaryEncoder_fig>>.

BeagleBone Black has built-in hardware for reading up to three encoders.  
Here, we'll use the _eQEP2_ encoder via the Linux +count+ subsystem.


Then run the following commands:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>config-pin P8_11 qep</strong>
bone$ <strong>config-pin P8_12 qep</strong>
bone$ <strong>show-pins | grep qep</strong>
P8.12        12 fast rx  up  4 qep 2 in A    ocp/P8_12_pinmux (pinmux_P8_12_qep_pin)
P8.11        13 fast rx  up  4 qep 2 in B    ocp/P8_11_pinmux (pinmux_P8_11_qep_pin)
</pre>
++++

This will enable _eQEP2_ on pins +P8_11+ and +P8_12+.  The +2+ after the +qep+ returned by +show-pins+ shows it's _eQEP2_.  

Finally, add the code in <<digital_rotaryEncoder_js>> to a file named _rotaryEncoder.js_ and run it.

=== Acquiring Data by Using a Smart Sensor over a Serial Connection
// TODO
==== Problem

((("sensors", "smart")))((("streaming data")))((("global positioning system (GPS)")))((("microcontrollers, reading data from")))((("data", "streaming")))You want to connect a smart sensor that uses a built-in microcontroller to stream data, such as a global positioning system (GPS), to the Bone and read the data from it.

==== Solution

((("serial ports", "UARTs")))((("UARTs (serial ports)")))The Bone has several serial ports (UARTs) that you can use to read data from an external microcontroller included in smart sensors, such as a GPS. Just wire one up, and you'll soon be gathering useful data, such as your own location.

Here's what you'll need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires
* GPS receiver

Wire your GPS, as shown in <<digital_GPS_fig>>.

=== Measuring a Temperature

==== Problem

((("sensors", "temperature")))((("temperature sensors", "TMP101 sensor")))((("digital temperature sensors")))((("TMP101 sensor")))((("environmental sensors", "temperature")))((("I&#x00B2;C-based serial protocol")))You want to measure a temperature using a digital temperature sensor.

==== Solution

The TMP101 sensor is a common digital temperature sensor that uses a standard I^2^C-based serial protocol.

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires
* Two 4.7 k&#8486; resistors
* TMP101 temperature sensor

Wire the TMP101, as shown in <<sensors_i2cTemp_fig>>.

[[sensors_i2cTemp_fig]]
.Wiring an I^2^C TMP101 temperature sensor
image::figures/i2cTemp_bb.png[I^2^C  Temp]

There are two I^2^C buses brought out to the headers. <<sensors_cape_headers_i2c>> shows that you have wired your device to I^2^C bus +2+.

[[sensors_cape_headers_i2c]]
.Table of I^2^C outputs
image::figures/cape-headers-i2c.png[I^2^C  Temp]


Once the I^2^C  device is wired up, you can use a couple handy I^2^C tools to test the device. Because these are Linux command-line tools, you have to use +2+ as the bus number. +i2cdetect+, shown in <<js_i2cTools>>, shows which I^2^C  devices are on the bus. The +-r+ flag indicates which bus to use. Our TMP101 is appearing at address +0x49+. You can use the +i2cget+ command to read the value. It returns the temperature in hexidecimal and degrees C. In this example, 0x18 = 24{deg}C, which is 75.2{deg}F. (Hmmm, the office is a bit warm today.) Try warming up the TMP101 with your finger and running +i2cget+ again.

There is the temperature in milli-degrees C.

Other i2c devices are supported by the kernel.
You can try the Linux Kernel Driver Database, https://cateee.net/lkddb/ to see them.

Once the driver is in place, you can read it via code.

=== Reading Temperature via a Dallas 1-Wire Device

==== Problem

((("sensors", "temperature")))((("environmental sensors", "temperature")))((("temperature sensors", "Dallas Semiconductor DS18B20")))((("Dallas Semiconductor DS18B20")))((("DS18B20 temperature sensor")))You want to measure a temperature using a Dallas Semiconductor DS18B20 temperature sensor.

==== Solution

////
I need to double-check how we provide attribution for recipes, but we'll need to have something more than "From" followed by a link. For now, we should at least do something like what I've changed it to. --BS

--may A bigger question is, when do we need attribution?  I pull bits and pieces from everywhere and try to keep good records of sources.
////

The DS18B20 is an interesting temperature sensor that uses Dallas Semiconductor's 1-wire interface. The data communication requires only one wire! (However, you still need wires from ground and 3.3 V.) You can wire it to any GPIO port.

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires
* 4.7 k&#8486; resistor
* DS18B20 1-wire temperature sensor

Wire up as shown in <<sensors_1-wire_fig>>.

Each temperature sensor has a unique serial number, so you can have several all sharing the same data line.

((("audio files", "recording")))((("recording audio files")))((("capes", "audio")))((("USB audio adapters")))((("files", "audio")))BeagleBone doesn't have audio built in, but you want to play and record files.

==== Solution

One approach is to buy an audio cape (<<app_capes>>), but another, possibly cheaper approach is to buy a USB audio adapter, 
such as the one shown in <<usb_audio_dongle>>. Some adapters that I've tested are provided in <<app_misc>>.

In the +aplay+ output shown in <<sensors_alsa>>, you can see the USB adapter's audio out. By default, the Bone will send audio to the HDMI. You can change that default by creating a file in your home directory called _~/.asoundrc_ and adding the code in <<sensors_asoundrc>> to it.
