[[networking]]
== Internet of Things

=== Introduction

You can easily connect BeagleBone Black to the Internet via a wire (<<networking_wired>>), wirelessly (<<networking_wireless>>), or through the USB to a host and then to the Internet (<<networking_usb>>). Either way, it opens up a world of possibilities for the "Internet of Things" (IoT). 

Now that you're online, this chapter offers various things to do with your connection.

=== Accessing Your Host Computer's Files on the Bone

==== Problem
You want to access a file on a Linux host computer that's attached to the Bone.

==== Solution
If you are running Linux on a host computer attached to BeagleBone Black, it's not hard to mount the Bone's files on the host or the host's files on the Bone by using +sshfs+. Suppose that you want to access files on the host from the Bone. First, install +sshfs+:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>sudo apt install sshfs</strong>
</pre>
++++

Now, mount the files to an empty directory (substitute your username on the host computer for +username+ and the IP address of the host for +192.168.7.1+):

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>mkdir host</strong>
bone$ <strong>sshfs username@$192.168.7.1:. host</strong>
bone$ <strong>cd host</strong>
bone$ <strong>ls</strong>
</pre>
++++

The +ls+ command will now list the files in your home directory on your host computer.  You can edit them as if they were local to the Bone.  You can access all the files by substituting +:/+ for the +:.+ following the IP address.

You can go the other way, too. Suppose that you are on your Linux host computer and want to access files on your Bone. Install +sshfs+:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
host$ <strong>sudo apt install sshfs</strong>
</pre>
++++

and then access:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
host$ <strong>mkdir /mnt/bone</strong>
host$ <strong>sshfs debian@$192.168.7.2:/ /mnt/bone</strong>
host$ <strong>cd /mnt/bone</strong>
host$ <strong>ls</strong>
</pre>
++++

Here, we are accessing the files on the Bone as +debian+. We’ve mounted the entire file system, starting with +/+, so you can access any file. Of course, with great power comes great responsibility, so be careful.

==== Discussion
The +sshfs+ command gives you easy access from one computer to another. When you are done, you can unmount the files by using the following commands:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
host$ <strong>umount /mnt/bone</strong>
bone$ <strong>umount home</strong>
</pre>
++++

[[networking_builtin_server]]
=== Serving Web Pages from the Bone

==== Problem
You want to use BeagleBone Black as a web server.

==== Solution
BeagleBone Black already has the +nginx+ web server running.

When you point your browser to _192.168.7.2_, you are using the +nginx+ web server.  The web pages are served from _/var/www/html/. Add the HTML in <<networking_index_html>> to a file called _/var/www/html/test.html_, and then point your browser to _192.168.7.2://test.html_. 

[role="pagebreak-before"]
[[networking_index_html]]
.A sample web page (test.html)
====
[source, html]
----

include::code/test.html[Sample html]

----
====

You will see the web page shown in <<networking_node_page>>.

[[networking_node_page]]
.test.html as served by nginx
image::figures/nginxTest.png[test.html served by nginx]


[[networking_nodejs]]
=== Interacting with the Bone via a Web Browser

==== Problem
BeagleBone Black is interacting with the physical world nicely and you want to display that information on a web browser.

==== Solution
https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html[Flask] is a Python web framework built with a small core and easy-to-extend philosophy. <<networking_builtin_server>> shows how to use nginx, the web server that's already running. This recipe shows how easy it is to build your own server. This is an adaptation of https://towardsdatascience.com/python-webserver-with-flask-and-raspberry-pi-398423cc6f5d[Python WebServer With Flask and Raspberry Pi].

First, install flask:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>sudo apt update</strong>
bone$ <strong>sudo apt install python3-flask</strong>
</pre>
++++

All the code in is the Cookbook repo:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>git clone https://github.com/MarkAYoder/BoneCookbook</strong>
bone$ <strong>cd BoneCookbook/doc/06iod/code/flash</strong>
</pre>
++++

===== First Flask - hello, world
Our first example is *helloWorld.py*

[[flask_hello_world]]
.Python code for flask hello world (helloWorld.py)
====
[source, python]
----

include::code/flask/helloWorld.py[simple flask-based web server]

----
====
<1> The first line loads the Flask module into your Python script. 

<2> The second line creates a Flask object called _app_. 

<3> The third line is where the action is, it says to run the index() function when someone accesses the root URL (‘/’) of the server. In this case, send the text “hello, world” to the client’s web browser via return.

<4> The last line says to “listen” on port 8080, reporting any errors.

Now on your host computer, browse to +192.168.7.2:8080+ and you should see.

[[flask_flaskServer]]
.Test page served by our custom flask server
image::figures/flaskServer.png[Test page]

===== Adding a template
Let’s improve our “hello, world” application, by using an HTML template and a CSS file for styling our page.  Note: these have been created for you in the “templates” sub-folder. So, we will create a file named *index1.html*, that has been saved in */templates*.

Here's what's in *templates/index1.html*:

[[flask_index1]]
.html code for flask hello world (index1.html)
====
[source, html]
----

include::code/flask/templates/index1.html[index1.html]

----
====

Note: a style sheet (style.css) is also included. This will be populated later.

Observe that anything in double curly braces within the HTML template is interpreted as a variable that would be passed to it from the Python script via the render_template function. Now, let’s create a new Python script. We will name it app1.py:


[[flask_app1]]
.Python code for flask index1.html (app1.py)
====
[source, html]
----

include::code/flask/app1.py[app1]

----
====

Note that we create a formatted string("timeString") using the date and time from the "now" object, that has the current time stored on it.

Next important thing on the above code, is that we created a dictionary of variables (a set of keys, such as the title that is associated with values, such as HELLO!) to pass into the template. On “return”, we will return the index.html template to the web browser using the variables in the templateData dictionary.

Execute the Python script:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>.\app1.py</strong>
</pre>
++++

Open any web browser and browse to 192.168.7.2:8080. You should see:

[[flask_app1_fig]]
.Test page served by app1.py
image::figures/flaskapp1.png[app1.py]

Note that the page’s content changes dynamically any time that you refresh it with the actual variable data passed by Python script. In our case, “title” is a fixed value, but “time” changes every second.

=== Displaying GPIO Status in a Web Browser - reading a button

==== Problem
You want a web page to display the status of a GPIO pin.

==== Solution
This solution builds on the Flask-based web server solution in <<networking_nodejs>>.  

To make this recipe, you will need:

* Breadboard and jumper wires
* Pushbutton switch

Wire your pushbutton as shown in <<js_pushbutton_fig>>. 

Wire a button to *P9_11* and have the web page display the value of the button.

Let’s use a new Python script named *app2.py*.

[[flask_app2]]
.A simple Flask-based web server to read a GPIO (app2.py)
====
[source, python]
----

include::code/flask/app2.py[]

----
====
Look that what we are doing is defining the button on *P9_11* as input, reading its value and storing it in *buttonSts*. Inside the function *index()*, we will pass that value to our web page through “button” that is part of our variable dictionary: *templateData*.

Let’s also see the new *index2.html* to show the GPIO status:

[[flask_index2]]
.A simple Flask-based web server to read a GPIO (index2.html)
====
[source, html]
----

include::code/flask/templates/index2.html[]

----
====

Now, run the following command:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>./app2.py</strong>
</pre>
++++

Point your browser to _http://192.168.7.2:8080_, and the page will look like <<networking_GPIOserver_fig>>.

[[flask_app2_fig]]
.Status of a GPIO pin on a web page
image::figures/flaskapp2.png[GPIO status]

Currently, the +0+ shows that the button isn't pressed. Try refreshing the page while pushing the button, and you will see +1+ displayed.

==== Discussion
It's not hard to assemble your own HTML with the GPIO data. It's an easy extension to write a program to display the status of all the GPIO pins.

=== Controlling GPIOs

==== Problem
You want to control an LED attached to a GPIO pin.

==== Solution
Now that we know how to “read” GPIO Status, let’s change them. What we will do will control the LED via the web page. We have an LED connected to *P9_14*. Controlling remotely we will change its status from LOW to HIGH and vice-versa.

The python script Let’s create a new Python script and named it *app3.py*.

[[flask_app3]]
.A simple Flask-based web server to read a GPIO (app3.py)
====
[source, python]
----

include::code/flask/app3.py[]

----
====

What we have new on above code is the new “route”:
====
@app.route("/<deviceName>/<action>")
====
From the webpage, calls will be generated with the format:

====
http://192.168.7.2:8081/ledRed/on
====
or
====
http://192.168.7.2:8081/ledRed/off
====
For the above example, *ledRed* is the “deviceName” and *on* or *off* are examples of possible “action”. Those routes will be identified and properly “worked”. The main steps are:

* Convert the string “ledRED”, for example, on its equivalent GPIO pin.

The integer variable ledRed is equivalent to P9_14. We store this value on variable “actuator”

* For each actuator, we will analyze the “action”, or “command” and act properly.
If “action = on” for example, we must use the command: +f.write("1")+

* Update the status of each actuator
* Update the variable library
* Return the data to index.html

Let’s now create an index.html to show the GPIO status of each actuator and more importantly, create “buttons” to send the commands:

[[flask_index3]]
.A simple Flask-based web server to write a GPIO (index3.html)
====
[source, html]
----

include::code/flask/templates/index3.html[]

----
====

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>./app3.py</strong>
</pre>
++++

Point your browser as before and you will see:

[[flask_app3_fig]]
.Status of a GPIO pin on a web page
image::figures/flaskapp3.png[Control LED]

Try clicking the "TURN ON" and "TURN OFF" buttons and your LED will respond.

*app4.py* and *app5.py* combine the previous apps.  Try them out.

=== Plotting Data

==== Problem
You have live, continuous,  data coming into your Bone via one of the Analog Ins, and you want to plot it.

==== Solution
Analog in - Continuous
(This is based on information at: http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-linux/esd/docs/latest/linux/Foundational_Components/Kernel/Kernel_Drivers/ADC.html#Continuous%20Mode)

Reading a continuous analog signal requires some set up. First go to the iio devices directory.

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>cd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0</strong>
bone$ <strong>ls -F</strong>
buffer/  in_voltage0_raw  in_voltage2_raw  in_voltage4_raw  in_voltage6_raw  name      power/          subsystem@
dev      in_voltage1_raw  in_voltage3_raw  in_voltage5_raw  in_voltage7_raw  of_node@  scan_elements/  uevent
</pre>
++++

Here you see the files used to read the one shot values. Look in +scan_elements+ to see how to enable continuous input.

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>ls scan_elements</strong>
in_voltage0_en     in_voltage1_index  in_voltage2_type   in_voltage4_en     in_voltage5_index  in_voltage6_type
in_voltage0_index  in_voltage1_type   in_voltage3_en     in_voltage4_index  in_voltage5_type   in_voltage7_en
in_voltage0_type   in_voltage2_en     in_voltage3_index  in_voltage4_type   in_voltage6_en     in_voltage7_index
in_voltage1_en     in_voltage2_index  in_voltage3_type   in_voltage5_en     in_voltage6_index  in_voltage7_type
</pre>
++++
Here you see three values for each analog input, _en (enable), _index (index of this channel in the buffer’s chunks) and _type (How the ADC stores its data). (See the link above for details.) Let's use the input at *P9_40* which is *AIN1*. To enable this input:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>echo 1 > scan_elements/in_voltage1_en</strong>
</pre>
++++
Next set the buffer size.

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>ls buffer</strong>
data_available  enable  length  watermark
</pre>
++++
Let's use a 512 sample buffer. You might need to experiment with this.

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>echo 512 > buffer/length</strong>
</pre>
++++
Then start it running.

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>echo 1 > buffer/enable</strong>
</pre>
++++
Now, just read from +/dev/iio:device0+.

[[analog_sine_fig]]
.1KHz sine wave sampled at 8KHz
image::figures/Sine1k.png[1KHz sine wave sampled at 8KHz]

An example Python program that does the above and the reads and plot the buffer is here: analogInContinuous.py 

[[analog_code]]
.Code to read and plot a continuous analog input(analogInContinuous.py)
====
[source, python]
----
include::code/analogInContinuous.py[]
----
====

Be sure to read the instillation instructions in the comments. Also note this uses X windows and you need to +ssh -X 192.168.7.2+ for X to know where the display is.

Run it:

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
host$ <strong>ssh -X bone</strong>

bone$ <strong>cd <Cookbook repo>/doc/06iot/code</strong>
bone$ <strong>./analogInContinuous.py</strong>
Hit ^C to stop
</pre>
++++
// TODO verify this works. fonts are taking too long to load
<<analog_sine_fig>> is the output of a 1KHz sine wave.

It's a good idea to disable the buffer when done.

++++
<pre>
bone$ <strong>echo 0 > /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/buffer/enable</strong>
</pre>
++++

===== Analog in - Continuous, Change the sample rate
The built in ADCs sample at 8k samples/second by default. They can run as fast as 200k samples/second by editing a device tree.

++++
<pre>
bone$ <strong>cd /opt/source/bb.org-overlays</strong>
bone$ <strong>make</strong>
</pre>
++++

This will take a while the first time as it compiles all the device trees.

++++
<pre>
bone$ <strong>vi src/arm/src/arm/BB-ADC-00A0.dts</strong>
</pre>
++++
Around line 57 you'll see
++++
<pre>
Line    Code
 57     // For each step, number of adc clock cycles to wait between setting up muxes and sampling.
 58     //  range: 0 .. 262143
 59     //  optional, default is 152 (XXX but why?!)
 60     ti,chan-step-opendelay = <152 152 152 152 152 152 152 152>;
 61     //`
 62     // XXX is there any purpose to set this nonzero other than to fine-tune the sample rate?
 63 
 64 
 65     // For each step, how many times it should sample to average.
 66     //  range: 1 .. 16, must be power of two (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16)
 67     //  optional, default is 16
 68     ti,chan-step-avg = <16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16>;

</pre>
++++
The comments give lots of details on how to adjust the device tree  to change the sample rate.
Line 68 says for every sample returned, average 16 values. This will give you a cleaner signal, but if you want to go fast, change the 16's to 1's. Line 60 says to delay 152 cycles between each sample. Set this to 0 to got as fast a possible.
++++
<pre>
ti,chan-step-avg = <1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1>;
ti,chan-step-opendelay = <0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00>;
</pre>
++++
Now compile it.

++++
<pre>
bone$ <strong>make</strong>
  DTC     src/arm/BB-ADC-00A0.dtbo
gcc -o config-pin ./tools/pmunts_muntsos/config-pin.c
</pre>
++++
+make+ knows to only recompile the file you just edited. Now install and reboot.
++++
<pre>
bone$ <strong>sudo make install</strong>
...

'src/arm/BB-BBBMINI-00A0.dtbo' -> '/lib/firmware/BB-BBBMINI-00A0.dtbo'
...
bone$ <strong>reboot</strong>
</pre>
++++
A number of files get installed, including the ADC file. Now try rerunning.

++++
<pre>
bone$ <strong>cd <Cookbook repo>/docs/06iot/code></strong>
bone$ <strong>./analogInContinuous.py</strong>
Hit ^C to stop

=== Sending an Email

==== Problem
You want to send an email via Gmail from the Bone.

==== Solution
This example came from https://realpython.com/python-send-email/. 
First, you need to https://mail.google.com[set up a Gmail account], if you don't already have one. Then add the code in <<networking_nodemailer_code>> to a file named _emailTest.py_. Substitute your own Gmail username.  For the password:

* Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
* Select App password.
* Generate your own 16 char password and copy it into _emailTest.py_.
* Be sure to delete password when done https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords .

++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
bone$ <strong>chmod +x emailTest.py</strong>
bone$ <strong>.\emailTest.py</strong>
</pre>
++++

[WARNING]
====
This solution requires your Gmail password to be in plain text in a file, which is a security problem. Make sure you know who has access to your Bone. Also, if you remove the microSD card, make sure you know who has access to it. Anyone with your microSD card can read your Gmail password.
====

==== Discussion
Be careful about putting this into a loop.  Gmail presently limits you to http://group-mail.com/email-marketing/how-to-send-bulk-emails-using-gmail/[500 emails per day and 10 MB per message].

See https://realpython.com/python-send-email/ for an example that sends an attached file.

=== Displaying the Current Weather Conditions

==== Problem
You want to display the current weather conditions.

==== Solution
Because your Bone is on the network, it's not hard to access the current weather conditions from a weather API. 

* Go to https://openweathermap.org/ and create an account.
* Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys and get your API key.
* Store your key in the +bash+ variable +APPID+.
++++
<pre>
bash$ <strong>export APPID="Your key"</strong>
</pre>
++++
* Then add the code in <<networking_weather_code>> to a file named _weather.js_.
* Run the pyhon script.


[[networking_weather_code]]

==== Discussion
The weather API returns lots of information. Use Python to extract the information you want.

=== Sending and Receiving Tweets

==== Problem
You want to send and receive tweets (Twitter posts) with your Bone.

==== Solution

https://twitter.com/[Twitter] has a whole https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code[git repo] of sample code for interacting with Twitter.  Here I'll show how to create a tweet and then how to delete it.

===== Creating a Project and App

* Follow the https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps/overview[directions here] to create a project and and app. 
* Be sure to give your app Read and Write permission.
* Then go to the https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps[developer portal] and select your app by clicking on the gear icon to the right of the app name.  
* Click on the *Keys and tokens* tab. Here you can get to all your keys and tokens.  

[TIP]
====
Be sure to record them, you can't get them later.
====
* Open the file +twitterKeys.sh+ and record your keys in it.
++++
<pre data-type="programlisting">
export API_KEY='XXX'
export API_SECRET_KEY='XXX'
export BEARER_TOKEN='XXX'
export TOKEN='4XXX'
export TOKEN_SECRET='XXX'
</pre>
++++
* Next, source the file so the values will appear in your bash session.
++++
<pre>
bash$ <strong>source twitterKeys.sh</strong>

=== Wiring the IoT with Node-RED
// TODO  This needs updating
==== Problem
You want BeagleBone to interact with the Internet, but you want to program it graphically.

==== Solution
http://nodered.org/[Node-RED] is a visual tool for wiring the IoT. It makes it easy to turn on a light when a certain hashtag is tweeted, or spin a motor if the forecast is for hot weather.

===== Installing Node-RED
To install Node-RED, run the following commands:

===== Building a Node-RED Flow - Twitter
The example in this recipe builds a Node-RED flow that will toggle an LED whenever a certain hashtag is tweeted. But first, you need to set up the Node-RED flow with the +twitter+ node:

. On the Node-RED web page, scroll down until you see the +social+ nodes on the left side of the page.
. Drag the +twitter+ node to the canvas, as shown in <<networking_node_twitter_fig>>.

[[networking_node_twitter_fig]]
.Node-RED twitter node
image::figures/node-twitter.png[node-red]

[start=3]
. Authorize Twitter by double-clicking the +twitter+ node. You'll see the screen shown in <<networking_node_twitter_auth_fig>>.

[[networking_node_twitter_auth_fig]]

[start=8]
. Go back to the left panel, scroll up to the top, and then drag the +debug+ node to the canvas. (+debug+ is in the +output+ section.)
. Connect the two nodes by clicking and dragging (<<networking_node_twitter_debug_fig>>).

[[networking_node_twitter_debug_fig]]
.Node-RED Twitter adding +debug+ node and connecting
image::figures/node-twitter-debug.png[node-red debug]

[start=10]
. In the right panel, in the upper-right corner, click the "debug" tab.
. Finally, click the Deploy button above the "debug" tab.

Your Node-RED flow is now running on the Bone. Test it by going to Twitter and tweeting something with the hashtag +#BeagleBone+. Your Bone is now responding to events happening out in the world.

===== Adding an LED Toggle
Now, we're ready to add the LED toggle:

. Wire up an LED as shown in <<displays_externalLED>>. Mine is wired to +P9_14+.  
. Scroll to the bottom of the left panel and drag the +bbb-discrete-out+ node (second from the bottom of the +bbb+ nodes) to the canvas and wire it (<<networking_node_bbb_out_fig>>).

[[networking_node_bbb_out_fig]]
.Node-RED adding bbb-discrete-out node
image::figures/node-disc-out.png[node-red discrete out node]

[start=3]
. Double-click the node, select your GPIO pin and "Toggle state," and then set "Startup as" to +1+ (<<networking_node_bbb_out_setup_fig>>).

[[networking_node_bbb_out_setup_fig]]
.Node-RED adding bbb-discrete-out configuration
image::figures/node-disc-out-setup.png[node-red discrete out setup]

[start=4]
. Click Ok and then Deploy.

Test again. The LED will toggle every time the hashtag +#BeagleBone+ is tweeted. With a little more exploring, you should be able to have your Bone ringing a bell or spinning a motor in response to tweets.


// === Communicating over a Serial Connection to an Arduino or LaunchPad
// // TODO Test
// ==== Problem
// You would like your Bone to talk to an Arduino or LaunchPad.

// ==== Solution
// The common serial port (also know as a UART) is the simplest way to talk between the two.  Wire it up as shown in <<networking_launchPad_fig>>.

// [WARNING]
// ====
// BeagleBone Black runs at 3.3 V. When wiring other devices to it, ensure that they are also 3.3 V. The LaunchPad I'm using is 3.3 V, but many Arduinos are 5.0 V and thus won't work. Or worse, they might damage your Bone.

// <5> Wait for characters to arrive on the serial port.

// <1> Select which serial port to use. <<networking_cape-headers-serial_fig>> shows what's available. We've wired +P9_24+ and +P9_26+, so we are using serial port +/dev/ttyO1+. (Note that's the letter _O_ and not the number _zero_.)

// <2> Set the baudrate to 9600, which matches the setting on the LaunchPad.

// <3> Read one line at a time up to the newline character (+\n+).

// <4> Open the serial port and call +onSerial()+ whenever there is data available.

// <5> Determine what event has happened on the serial port and respond to it.

// <6> If the serial port has been ++open++ed, start calling +sendCommand()+ every 1000 ms.

// <7> These are the two commands to send.

// <8> Write the character out to the serial port and to the LaunchPad.

// <9> Move to the next command.

// [[networking_cape-headers-serial_fig]]
// .Table of UART outputs
// image::figures/cape-headers-serial.png[UART outputs]

// ==== Discussion
// When you run the script in <<js_launchPadBeagle_code>>, the Bone opens up the serial port and every second sends a new command, either +r+ or +g+. The LaunchPad waits for the command and, when it arrives, responds by toggling the corresponding LED.
